Here are two little python scripts for analysing the stress tensor file
(stress . whatever) from lammps. The first (extractStress.py) simply goes
through the stress tensor file and for each data set (single timestep)
converts the stress tensor data into the pressure tensor and writes the
data from each timestep to a separate file. To run it use
python ./extractStress.py <input file> <output file>
and it will produce files called <output file>.XXXXX (timestep). This may
produce quite a few files for your longer runs.
 
The second (blockStress.py) is quite similar but it block averages the
stress tensor data (averages together a number of different datasets).
This is run by python ./blockStress.py <input file> <output file> <no of
data sets to average together>
 
In both cases the format of the output files are
z pxx pyy pzz pxy pxz pyz pzz-(pxx+pyy)/2
where pab are the components of the pressure tensor (integrating the final
column should give the surface tension although this is very sensitive to
noise).
