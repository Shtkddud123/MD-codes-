The code here is to implement the steered molecular dynamics method to a bilayer/nanoparticle simulation, 
using the SDK model, as seen in the following publications: 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20438090

The MD simulations themselves are implemented in LAMMPS:

The SDK model comes with the most recent release of the LAMMPS package, so even though the installation procedure is tedious, 
do take the effort to update the simulation package often. Fail early and often is the way to go!
